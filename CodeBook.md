Guide to decifering variables

id variables:
Subject: The number 1-30 of the subject who did the experiment
Activity: one of 6 activities performed(STANDING, SITTING, LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS) 

data variables:

angle: Angle between to vectors 
t():time domain signals
f():frequency domain signals
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
angle(): Angle between to vectors.
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean 
frequency 
X,Y,Z:the axis of the signal
Gyr:Gryoscope signal
Body:measurement of Body movement
Jerk:the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time
Gravity:measurement of Gravity
Mag:the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm
Acc:Acceleration signal
